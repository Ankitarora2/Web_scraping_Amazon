this code is designed to scrape multiple pages of search results, with the number of pages defined by the "num_pages" variable. By default, it is set to 20, which means that the code will scrape the first 20 pages of search results. If each page displays 10 products, then the code will scrape up to 200 products. If each page displays a different number of products, then the total number of products scraped may be different.
